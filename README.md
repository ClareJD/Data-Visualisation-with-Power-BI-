Using a dataset that I previously cleaned using RStudio, I created a dashboard as per the using the below parameters: 

  1. The average Rotten Tomato rating of each genre. 
  2. The number of movie produced per year.
  3. The Audience Score for each film.
  4. Porfitability per studio.
  5. The World Wide Gross per Genre

I also created an additional dashboard that looked at the top performers across the data.
